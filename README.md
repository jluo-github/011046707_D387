submitted.
Welcome to Advanced Java! This is an opportunity for students to write multithreaded object-oriented code using Java
frameworks and determine how to deploy software applications using cloud services.
FOR SPECIFIC TASK INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS ASSESSMENT, PLEASE REFER TO THE COURSE PAGE.

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
For this assessment, you will modify a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include
multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, build a Docker image
of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerize it using the supporting documents provided in this
task.
